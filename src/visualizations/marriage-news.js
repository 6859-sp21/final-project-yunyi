      <h3>Beaten to Death: Two Years</h3>
      <p>
        In 2017, a 22-year-old woman Fang Yangyang was beaten to death by
        her husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law. Autopsy shows that she had been mistreated
        severely prior to her death. Despite their cruelty, Fang's husband and in-laws were only
        sentenced to up to three years in prison.

      <h3>The Silenced Movement</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020, a well-known TikToker Lamu was burned to death by her ex-husband, Tang.
        People later found out that the police did nothing to Lamu's prior report on Tang's threats.
        After this incident, people protested online for a better system to issue restraining orders, but
        the movement was quickly silenced.
