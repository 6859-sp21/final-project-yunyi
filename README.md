Abstract: In this project, we develop an interactive website that introduces and visualizes the gender inequality in China. It includes visualizations using multiple datasets that focus on discrimination faced by Chinese women in different life stages. For each life stage, it uses scrollytelling to display the data together with paragraphs that provides the contexts of the data. We hope that this website brings awareness to different parties on the gender inequalities faced by women living in China.
